## **Scala Application to find the GCD of two numbers.**

**Task:**

**Create a Scala application to find the GCD of two numbers.**

**Solution:**

To find the GCD of two numbers we can have  the below logic:

If either 1st or 2nd number is 0, then the other number is the Greatest Common Divisor.

Else call the GCD function again by sending the 2nd number as the 1st number and the difference between the 2 numbers as the 2nd number and this in turn checks for the If clause again.

In the above code, we  have taken the input for the GCD function in 2 ways:
From the Command Line Arguments 		and
From the User through the Standard Input

**OUTPUT:**

From the Command Line Arguments
