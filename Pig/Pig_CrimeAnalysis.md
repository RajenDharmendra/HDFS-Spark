**Big Data Mini Project on USA Crime Analysis**
-------------------------------------------

**Task:**


Write a MapReduce/Pig program to calculate the number of cases investigated under each FBI code

Write a MapReduce/Pig program to calculate the number of cases investigated under Ward 32

Write a MapReduce/Pig program to calculate the number of arrests in theft district wise

Write a MapReduce/Pig program to calculate the number of arrests done between October 2014 and October 2015


**Dataset:**


Introduction:

This dataset contains attributes related to crimes taking place in various areas like type of crime, FBI code related to that criminal case, arrest frequency, location of crime etc.

Dataset Description:

The columns present in the dataset:

ID, Case Number, Date, Block, IUCR, Primary Type, Description, Location Description, Arrest, Domestic, Beat, District, Ward, Community Area, FBICode, X Coordinate, Y Coordinate, Year, Updated On, Latitude, Longitude, Location

**Solution:**
Pig program to calculate the number of cases investigated under each FBI code

Start the pig terminal in local mode
Loading the dataset into the relation crimeDataset using the Pig CSV parser and specifying that the data is comma separated, not multiline, should be in Unix format and to skip the header

In following load statement, we havenâ€™t specified the datatype of each column, therefore the default type of all columns of the dataset is bytearray

    crimeDataset = LOAD '/path/to/filr/in/local/file/system/Crimes_-_2001_to_present.csv' USING org.apache.pig.piggybank.storage.CSVExcelStorage
    (',','NO_MULTILINE','UNIX','SKIP_INPUT_HEADER') AS (ID,Case_Number,Date,Block,IUCR,Primary_Type,Description,Location_Description,Arrest,Domestic,Beat,Distirct,Ward,Community_Area,FBI_Code,XCordinate,YCordinate,Year,UpdatedOn,Lattitude,Logitute,Location);

Generating the data (each row) of the above loaded relation with the corresponding datatype for each column. We can also convert all columns to chararray datatype

    crimeDataset_Converted = FOREACH crimeDataset GENERATE $0 AS ID:int,$1 AS Case_Number:chararray,$2 AS Date:chararray,$3 AS Block:chararray,$4 AS IUCR:chararray,$5 AS Primary_type:chararray,$6 AS Description:chararray,$7 AS Location_Description:chararray,$8 AS Arrest:chararray,$9 AS Domestic:boolean,$10 AS Beat:int,$11 AS Distirct:int,$12 AS Ward:int,$13 AS Community_Area:int,$14 AS FBI_Code:chararray,$15 AS XCordinate:int,$16 AS YCordinate:int,$17 AS Year:int,$18 AS UpdatedOn:chararray,$19 AS Lattitude:float,$20 AS Longitute:float,$21 AS Location:chararray);



Group all the data in the data-loaded relation crimeDataset by FBICode in the relation groupFBICodes. This will result in groups of record for each FBICode

    groupFBICodes = GROUP crimeDataset BY FBI_Code;

Generating all cases under each FBICode by flattening (removing/un-nest the tuples) each group and counting the records in each flatten group and storing it in the relation casesUnderEachFBICode. Thus, we get the number of cases investigated under each FBI code

    casesUnderEachFBICode = FOREACH groupFBICodes GENERATE FLATTEN(group) AS FBI_Code,COUNT($1)

Displaying the result in the relation casesUnderEachFBICode

    DUMP casesUnderEachFBICode;
